# PlanðŸŒŽIt

# Description:

PlanðŸŒŽIt is a user friendly organization application where you can add/update/delete goals and tasks. The idea is to take someone who may be scatterbrained and get them organized. Users can input as many ideas, goals, and tasks they would like to accomplish, specify a category, and then PlanðŸŒŽIt does the hard part for them: completely organizes everything in an easy to understand, easy to manage way. You can even specify a date and see your tasks sorted by a date selected on a calendar. Simply make an account and get planning!
